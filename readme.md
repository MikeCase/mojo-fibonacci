Various thing's I've made with mojo 0.2.1

* main.mojo - a fibonacci algorithm with mojo
* fib_python.py - a python version of the above algorithm
* mojo_argv_test.mojo - testing with the arg module.
* mojo_python_stuff.mojo - testing various python integrations.
* requests_usage.mojo - testing pythons request module with mojo
* todo_list.mojo - a todo list written in mojo from a youtube tutorial
* fileio - A fileIO package I took a shot at using pythons builtins.. Wont compile. 

None of this is finished, just ideas and tryouts with mojo.
